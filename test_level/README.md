# Testing levels

> Broadly speaking, there are at least three levels of testing: unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

Though there is an [acceptance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_acceptance_testing) usually being included by developers, it will not be discussed here. Hence, this directory is divided into three classes:

- [unit testing](./unit_testing.md)
- [integration testing](./integration_testing.md)
- [system testing](./system_testing.md)
