# Unit Testing

## Overview

> In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

Unit tests are typically automated tests to test on individual functions or procedures.

In the scope of object-oriented programming, a unit can be a class that we created. We can write testing to make sure that the implementation produce correct output.

Unit testing will be broken into following sections:
