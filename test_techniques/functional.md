# Functional Testing vs Non-Functional Testing

## Functional Testing

> Functional testing is a type of testing which verifies that each function of the software application operates in conformance with the requirement specification.

This testing mainly involves black box testing as it only verifies the functionality of the system. Testings involving User Interface, APIs, Database, etc. falls into this category.

## Non-Functional Testing

> Non-functional testing is a type of testing to check non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability, etc.) of a software application.

This testing mainly focuses on user experience. It is equally important as functional testing since it affects client satisfaction.

## Key difference

- Functional testing verifies each function/feature of the software whereas Non Functional Testing verifies non-functional aspects like performance, usability, reliability, etc.
- Functional testing can be done manually whereas Non Functional testing is hard to perform manually
- Functional testing based on customer's requirements whereas Non Functional testing is based on customer's expectations.
- Functional testing has a goal to validate software actions whereas Non Functional testing has a goal to validate the performance of the software.
- Functional testing is performed before the non-functional testing.
